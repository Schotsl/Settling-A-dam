      <h2>If you want something done right, do it yourself!</h2>
      <p>Now that you’ve read all about ponzi schemes and the great things they brought onto this world for the
        investors and the creators of said ponzi schemes. Now you want to start your very own? You’ve come to the
        right
        place! You can read up below to get started: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Create an investment vehicle</h2>
          <p>You will have to create an investment vehicle that promises returns well above market rates for the risk
            level but still manages to sound convincing.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Get investors</h2>
          <p>Get the first few investors to sign up. Encourage them to get their friends to sign up. You need a lot of
            new cash coming in all the time, so you will need a really effective marketing system.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Keep low</h2>
          <p>Try to avoid being discovered by the authorities. You may pretend to be legitimate and fake the books, or
            operate totally illegally, pulling in people by specifically offering illegal investments. Remeber every
            additional person you involve to market or help hide you scheme may well betray you by taking the money or
            informing the authorities.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Prepare for the worst</h2>
          <p>Plan for the scheme falling over. They <b>all</b> do eventually - it’s in the nature of a Ponzi scheme
            that they tend to have short lives. Work out how you will avoid the authorities. This may involve moving
            to a country with no extradition to yours, such as North Korea (most countries will extradite given
            reasonable evidence).</p>
          <p>Work out how you will avoid people you have stolen from. Depending on who they are they may well have the
            money and resources to take action where the law cannot. Expect to have to live under a different identity
            and have considerable security needs.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The worst</h2>
          <p>All the assets of the scheme, as well as all your personal assets will be seized. You will need to get
            money out of the country before you are caught and sent to your target country without it being flagged as
            suspicious. This will not be easy as the target country will be one your country will not often deal with
            (as otherwise, it’s no use as they will extradite you)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The end</h2>
          <p>Plan some hobbies to keep you busy in prison. You may also wish to take some self defence training, in
            case anyone you stole from is also there, or is wealthy enough to pay someone already in there to do you
            harm.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
