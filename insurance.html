			<h1>Insurance</h1>

			<p>
				If you arrive in the Netherlands it is important to arrange a Dutch health insurance as quickly as possible.
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Compulsory health insurance</h2>

				<p>Generally, health insurance is compulsory when the Dutch government considers you a resident of the
					Netherlands, and from the moment you register with a Dutch municipality.</p>

				<p>Within 4 months you have to take out health insurance. During those 4 months you will be covered under the
					standard health insurance package. Please be aware that you will have to pay premiums afterwards for those
					first months.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Health insurance for foreign students</h2>

				<p>If you are a student from outside the Netherlands, often you will already have health insurance in your home
					country. However, sometimes you are still required to take out health insurance in the Netherlands. This
					depends on your personal situation, for example where you are from and what else you do besides studying. We
					advise you to consult the Nuffic website Studyinholland.nl to check whether you are <a
						href="https://www.studyinholland.nl/plan-your-stay/insurance">properly insured</a>.</p>

				<p>It is good to know that there are also insurance companies that offer special packages for international
					students. For example <a href="http://www.loonzorg.com/students">Loonzorg</a> offers packages that will cover
					most student health expenses.</p>
