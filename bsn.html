			<h1>BSN</h1>

			<p>
				You might have come across something called a BSN number before. But what exactly is this magic number everyone
				seems to be raving about? A BSN number is basically a citizenship number that you need to apply for once you
				start living and studying in the Netherlands.
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Why do you need one?</h2>

				<p>
					You need a BSN number. You can't not have one. With a BSN, not only are you officially registered in Amsterdam
					but you can also use it for various administrative procedures. For instance, you need your BSN to get
					insurance,
					apply for housing allowance, or get a job and a salary. What's more, you need it to apply for any sort of
					benefit, like student finance.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>How to apply</h2>

				<p>
					You automatically receive a BSN number when you register at a Dutch municipality (a gemeente). Basically, all
					you need to do is head on over to your city hall and ask to register. You should do this within 5 days of your
					arrival if you are planning on staying for more than 4 months, which most students are.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Deregistration</h2>

				<p>
					If you are leaving the Netherlands permanently, or if you will be living outside of the Netherlands for more
					than 8 non consecutive months, you must inform the Dutch Municipality where you live and deregister. You can
					do
					that as late as 5 days before your departure. Depending on your municipality, you may be able to do it online.
					In other cases, you can do it in person or via mail. Make sure you contact your Dutch Municipality for
					additional information and deregister on time.
