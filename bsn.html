			<h1>BSN</h1>

			<p>
				Everyone living in the Netherlands needs to be registered at their home address. When you register with the municipality, you will get a BSN (burgerservicenummer). This is basically a unique citizenship number for interaction with Dutch authorities. 
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Why do you need one?</h2>

				<p>
					This allows the Basisregistratie personen (BRP or Municipal Personal Records Database) to deal with emergencies, but also to monitor the amount of people living in the Netherlands and to allocate municipal taxes. The BSN is also used to combat identity fraud.
				</p>

				<p>
					You will need this BSN for any interaction with Dutch authorities, for example to work in the Netherlands and get a salary, to open a bank account, to use the healthcare system, to get insurance, and for various administrative procedures. 
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>How to apply</h2>

				<p>
					You need to register as a resident at the town hall in the municipality (gemeente) where you are living. You will need to handover a valid proof of identity, for example a passport (a driving licence is not allowed) and your address to be registered. When you are registered, you will automatically receive a BSN. 
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are planning on staying in the Netherlands for more than 4 months you need to be registered within 5 days after arrival.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Deregistration</h2>

				<p>
					Don’t forget to deregister again at the municipality if you are leaving the Netherlands permanently, or for more than 8 non consecutive months. This needs to be done as late as 5 days before leaving.
