			<h1>BSN</h1>

			<p>
				You might have come across something called a BSN number before. But what exactly is this magic number everyone
				seems to be raving about? A BSN number is basically a citizenship number that you need to apply for once you
				start living and studying in the Netherlands.

			<h2>Why do you need one?</h2>

			<p>
				You need a BSN number. You can't not have one. With a BSN, not only are you officially registered in Amsterdam
				but you can also use it for various administrative procedures. For instance, you need your BSN to get insurance,
				apply for housing allowance, or get a job and a salary. What's more, you need it to apply for any sort of
				benefit, like student finance.

			<h2>How to apply</h2>

			<p>
				You automatically receive a BSN number when you register at a Dutch municipality (a gemeente). Basically, all
				you need to do is head on over to your city hall and ask to register. You should do this within 5 days of your
				arrival if you are planning on staying for more than 4 months, which most students are.
