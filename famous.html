        <h2>Scott Rothstein</h2>
        <p>It isn't always finance types who run the biggest scams: Scott Rothstein used his Fort Lauderdale law firm to
          run an eye-popping $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. According to the Miami Herald, Rothstein convinced his investors
          to buy into bogus legal settlements. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 -- a term that's held
          despite his attempts at reduction.</p>

        <h2>R. Allen Stanford</h2>
        <p>Texas tycoon R. Allen Stanford masterminded a 20-year scheme via his offshore bank in Antigua, cheating
          almost 30,000 investors from more than 100 countries out of billions. The scam involved fake certificates of
          deposit, and prosecutors accused Stanford of funneling funds into his personal interests, including real
          estate and cricket tournaments. In 2012, Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in federal lockup.</p>

        <h2>Tom Petters</h2>
        <p>Businessman Tom Petters was accused of stealing money from hedge funds, missionaries and pastors alike,
          according to the New York Times. Petters promised investors that by pouring money into his organization,
          they'd fund the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit. But
          that's not what happened, and in 2010 Petters was sentenced to 50 years in prison. The scam is reportedly the
          biggest in Minnesota history. </p>

        <h2>Bernie Madoff</h2>
        <p>It's unclear at what point Bernie Madoff began shaping the largest Ponzi scheme in history; some believe it
          may
          have extended all the way back to the 1960s. Regardless of the timeframe, what is known is that he conned
          thousands of investors out of $20 billion in principal funds. After his arrest in 2008, he was sentenced to
          150
          years in prison, where he died on April 14 at the age of 82.</p>
