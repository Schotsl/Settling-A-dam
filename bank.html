			<h1>Banking</h1>

			<p>
				To get a debit card you need to open a Dutch bank account.
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Why do you need one?</h2>

				<p>In most stores you are not able to pay with a credit card, which is why you need a debit card. Through a bank
					account you are able to receive your salary, rent an apartment, or to pay ("pin") in shops. iDeal is a method
					of online payment in the Netherlands, also using your debit card.</p>

				<h2>How to open a bank account?</h2>

				<p>
					For most Dutch banks you need a BSN to open a bank account. If you are staying in the Netherlands for more
					than 4 months and you have BSN, you have various options to check out on <a
						href="https://www.amsterdamtips.com/open-dutch-bank-account">this</a> page.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are also some online banks where a BSN is not required, such as <a href="https://n26.com/en-eu">N26</a>
					and <a href="https://www.bunq.com">bunq</a>. Internet banking in the Netherlands is convenient and secure. You
					use your e.dentifier and your pin-code to pay for goods.
				</p>

				<p>You always need your address and ID to open a bank account</p>
