			<h1>Insurance</h1>

			<p>
				The OV-chipkaart is the new payment method for public transportation in trams, the metro and buses in the
				Netherlands.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Disposable OV-chipkaart</h2>

			<p>
				The disposable OV-chipkaart is made of stiff paper and cannot be topped up with credit. Thus, it is intended for
				travellers who do not use the Dutch public transportation system very often, for example tourists.
			</p>

			<p>
				The disposable OV-chipkaart can be purchased from machines or on-board, and since this type of card is topped up
				when you buy it, you can use it straight away to travel for one or 24 hours (unlimited travel for one day). Note
				that you have to check in and out with the disposable chipkaart otherwise it becomes invalid.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Anonymous OV-chipkaart</h2>

			<p>
				The anonymous OV-chipkaart (anonieme OV-chipkaart) is reusable, and once loaded with electronic credit it can be
				used for travelling. It can be used by the owner as well as by others, but not at the same time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Travellers pay per kilometre and the balance (saldo) can be topped up at machines and kiosks. However, note that
				you cannot load a season ticket onto the anonymous OV-chipkaart. 
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Personal OV-chipkaart</h2>

			<p>
				The personal OV-chipkaart (persoonlijke OV-chipkaart) is for one user and includes his / her name, date of
				birth, and photograph. Consequently, the personal version is non-transferable, but the owner does enjoy other
				benefits including the option to block it (for instance in case of theft) and automatic top up.
			</p>

			<p>
				The personal OV-chipkaart can also be loaded with an off-peak hours train travel discount from NS
				(voordeelurenabonnement). Finally, it is also possible to load the personal chipkaart with season tickets and
				other products.
