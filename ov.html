			<h1>OV-chipkaart</h1>

			<p>
				The Netherlands has a good <a href="https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/transportation/dutch-public-transportation">public transportation network</a>, consisting of trains, <a href="https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/transportation/dutch-public-transportation/metro">metros</a>, trams, buses and ferries, run by various transportation companies. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Travellers pay per kilometre. The main payment method for public transportation in the Netherlands is the OV-chipkaart. There are three types of OV-chipkaart available to check in and out when you are travelling with public transport: the disposable OV-chipkaart, the anonymous OV-chipkaart, and the personal OV-chipkaart. 
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Disposable OV-chipkaart</h2>

				<p>
					The disposable OV-chipkaart (wegwerp kaartje) is suitable for single use or for a short period, and is intended for travellers who do not travel very often such as tourists. The card is made of paper and is loaded with a specific travel product valid for a limited period. It cannot be topped up with credit. A disposable card usually works out more expensive.
				</p>

				<p>
					The disposable OV-chipkaart can be purchased with a travel product from machines at stations or on-board. Once it’s bought it can be used instantly since it is already loaded with a travel product.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Anonymous OV-chipkaart</h2>

				<p>
					The anonymous OV-chipkaart (anonieme OV-chipkaart) is suitable for more than a day or for longer distances. It is a plastic card with travel products or credit and it is reusable. The anonymous card can be bought at various <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/service-and-contact/service-points-finder.htm">service points</a>. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The card can be topped up at machines and kiosks in various shops, at train stations or in public transport. Once it is loaded with electronic credit it can be used for travelling. It can be used by any person. 
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Personal OV-chipkaart</h2>

				<p>
					If you are staying in the Netherlands for a longer period and you travel frequently, you can also apply for a personal OV-chipkaart (persoonlijke OV-chipkaart). This card is for one user only, and includes your name, date of birth, and photograph. A personal OV-chipkaart offers benefits, such as to block the card (for instance in case of theft) and to automatically top up. It can also be loaded with an off-peak hours train travel discount from NS, the Dutch railway company. 
				</p>

				<p>
					A chipkaart can be bought at the <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart.htm">website of OV-chipkaart</a>. By creating an <a href="https://login.ov-chipkaart.nl/authenticationendpoint/register.do?_ga=2.9053488.420179515.1636661837-1994029372.1636661837">OV-chip account</a> it is also possible to connect the card to your account and manage your settings from there.
