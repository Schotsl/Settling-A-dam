      <h2>Ruh-roh!</h2>
      <p>When researching a new investment opportunity, it's important to take the time and research the person
        offering the investment and the investment itself. This could save you a lot of time and money in the future,
        these are the most common signs of a ponzi scheme:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Abnormally high investment returns</h2>
          <p>The most obvious sign of any investment skulduggery is the promise of an abnormally high investment
            return. While Ponzi schemes may take a variety of forms, they all follow the same intrinsic theme:
            investors are promised they will make a much higher return than can be achieved through any conventional
            investment opportunity. When analysing investment opportunities, remember the adage: if it’s too good to
            be true, it probably is.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Guaranteed returns</h2>
          <p>The words "guaranteed returns" are designed to trigger both deep-seated investor greed and the willing
            belief that this is a "sure-fire thing’. However, when it comes to investing, no return is ever guaranteed
            and even the most modest investment carries some risk. Greed is your greatest enemy when investing. Be
            highly suspicious of anyone who offers you a guaranteed return on your investment.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Consistently high performance</h2>
          <p>By their very nature, the investment markets rise and fall over time, and your returns in any reputable
            investment will reflect these market fluctuations. Be sceptical of any investment that promises
            consistently positive returns regardless of overall market conditions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Vague business model</h2>
          <p>If you don’t understand the business model after a five-minute explanation, stay away. The investment’s
            business model should be easy to understand and, as an investor, one should be clear where and how returns
            are generated. Fraudsters are notorious for using complicated verbal constructs such as "hedge future
            trading’, "high yield investment’ and "offshore investment program’ to intimidate would-be investors.
            These are smoke-and-mirror tactics used to confuse and bully investors. As Warren Buffett is famous for
            saying: "Never invest in a business you can’t understand."</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The need for more investors</h2>
          <p>The survival of any Ponzi scheme is dependent on its ability to continually attract new investors.
            Without an ongoing stream of new investors, the fraudster is unable to pay the previous investors, and the
            whole scheme will unravel. If you are pressured into finding new investors or offered rewards for
            introducing new investors, alarm bells should be reverberating.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Pressure to reinvest</h2>
          <p>Ponzi schemes will collapse without regular income or if too many investors withdraw their funds. To
            remain afloat, the promoter will offer investors higher returns if they don’t cash out or if they reinvest
            their money. While on paper investors believe their investments are gaining incomparable ground, the truth
            is that most Ponzi schemes don’t make any investments on behalf of their investors at all. If you’re
            pressured or rewarded for reinvesting, be alarmed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The pressure to act now</h2>
          <p>Ponzi fraudsters are also notorious for creating a false sense of urgency by leading the investor to
            believe the deal is only valid for a limited time. The investment opportunity is often shrouded in
            secrecy, and the investor is pressured to ‘act now’ while the ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ window of opportunity
            stands obscurely and suspiciously ajar. The pressure to invest within a certain period is foreign to sound
            investing principles and should be considered a red flag.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Credibility through association</h2>
          <p>A Ponzi scheme promoter generally creates an air of exclusivity by luring would-be investors into his
            inner circle of family and friends. By proximity to those who are close to the fraudster, the investor’s
            fears are allayed – after all, foxes never prey near their dens and thieves don’t rob from their own
            homes. This is a powerful psychological tactic used by fraudsters to build credibility through association
            with reputable people who are known to them. Remember, Bernie Madoff managed to deceive those nearest and
            dearest to him, including his sons.</p>
