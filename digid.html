			<h1>DigiD</h1>

			<p>
				You will also need a DigiD (short for Digital Identification), a means of digital identification. It can be
				considered as a digital version of your passport, through which you can login. The DigiD consists of a username
				and password, and is linked to your BSN.
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Why do you need one?</h2>

				<p>
					A DigiD grants you access to many aspects of your online life. You need it for your online administration and
					to interact with certain services and government websites in the Netherlands. It allows you to access many
					websites, like the Belastingdienst (Dutch tax office), health insurance, or the police.
				</p>
