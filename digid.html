			<h1>DigiD</h1>

			<p>
				A DigiD is a digital Identification that you can apply for once you have your BSN. DigiIDs are used to access
				online government services. For example, to apply for benefits, health insurance, and to do your taxes you need
				a DigiD to log in.

			<h2>How to get a DigiID</h2>

			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://www.digid.nl/en">Request for one here.</a></li>
				<li>On the first page, fill in your personal details like your BSN, date of birth, postcode, and so on.</li>
				<li>Then, choose a username and password. Don't forget it, because then you'll need to reapply.</li>
				<li>You will get an email validation.</li>
				<li>Then, you will receive a letter with the final activation code. <a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/">Activate
						your DigiID</a> within 20 days.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				And that, friends, was the low-down on the BSN Number. Simple, right? All you really need to do is walk (or
				bike) to your local city hall and ask to be registered. Then, all you need to do is wait and then activate
				your
				DigiID.

			<h2>Deregistration</h2>

			<p>
				If you are leaving the Netherlands permanently, or if you will be living outside of the Netherlands for more
				than 8 nonconsecutive months, you must inform the Dutch Municipality where you live and deregister. You can
				do
				that as late as 5 days before your departure. Depending on your municipality, you may be able to do it
				online.
				In other cases, you can do it in person or via mail. Make sure you contact your Dutch Municipality for
				additional information and deregister on time.
